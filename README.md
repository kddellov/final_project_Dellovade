# final_project_Dellovade
## Part One
### Outline
The story I will tell is justification for why all schools should implement mental health screenings to all high school aged students at the beginning of each year.
To tell the story, I will first start by showing how mental health diseases have been increasing over time and then lead that into the prevalence for high school aged students. By using the data I will show what state mental disease is in for all ages and then break it down further to the target age. Mental health diseases have an average of age of onset of about 15 years old, but average treatment doesn't begin until about 26 years of age. This is because less than 15% of high school aged kids are ever even screened. Then show the percentage of adults obtained a lifelong mental health disorder that started in high school. I will then lead my call to action to be a mental health screening that can be distributd by teachers or guidance counselors. Also, show data that pilot studies have already run to show a program like this effects on classroom behavior, class behavior and more.

### Data
Data is utilized from the National Institute for Mental Health (https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness.shtml) , and also from a study aimed at measuring the severity of mental health disorders by comparing between age groups [Linked Here](https://github.com/kddellov/final_project_Dellovade/blob/master/Project%20Data.csv). Data was also pulled from [Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services](https://github.com/kddellov/final_project_Dellovade/blob/master/Copy%20of%20NSDUHsaeExcelTab01-2016.csv). The NIMH data is very robust and can be used in various ways to show macro level trends between things such as age, race or sex. Then I will compare down to a microlevel and the prevalence of obtaining a life long mental health disorder in the target range of my story, which is high school aged kids. I intend to use the data by also adding different elements such as pre-screening and treatment percentages as well (https://www.mhanational.org/online-depression-screening-data-and-statistics-0) and (https://nces.ed.gov/blogs/nces/post/explore-data-on-mental-health-services-in-k-12-public-schools-for-mental-health-awareness-month). Then show that these disorders can turn into life long diseases that begin in high school aged students ( https://namica.org/back-to-school-guide-maintaining-mental-health/) . 

### Method and Medium
I will use ShortHand to build the visualization. All of the visualizations will be recreated in Tableau and then imported into Shorthand. Throughout the story, I will be building to the point of the importance why mental health issues need to be addressed early on in life. I can furher reinforce the amount of relationships that can be affected, and also change the course of someones life. Policy makers must be held accountable in such a big issue such as mental health disorders. So additional funding to schools should be made available. 
## Part Two
### Research Protocol
The target audience is the general public that can use this knowledge to take to their school-boards or they can support with donations to National Alliance on Mental Illness, that has classes to teach parents and teachers early warning signs of mental health disorders. I thought the best people to interview would be ones that would be affected if this became a new policy for a school. So, I interviewed my sister and two of my cousins who all have kids. Ideally, their kids would have been high school age but their ages varied with only one kid being in high school. I sent them my wireframes first, let them look and study them, and then scheduled a call to ask questions. 

My interview script was conversational and was mainly aimed at the best way to showcase the data and their ability to understand what I am showing. For each graph I wanted to know if there was anything I should remove, add, or highlight. Next, I wanted to know if they had enough supporting information to support the point I am making. I was having trouble thinking of design/color themes, so I asked about that as well.

I was told that my theme should be different shades of green because the color for mental health awareness is green, so for all the final project it will be shades of green. All 3 of the interviewees thought I could combine some of the graphs because they were repetative, which I thought was interesting. I combined the Prevalence of Mental Disorder Age and Sex charts together. Originally the graph had age broken up into 5 different groups, but with adding more bars to the chart I had to remove 2 of the age groupings. I asked each of them again after I made the change and they believed that since my topic is worried about youth and not overall prevalence then it does not take away from the point of the graph. Someone also mentioned that I should include something subtle to be able to compare youth mental health to the average for all ages if it all possible, so I added it that to a few of the graphs. In the original story board, I included a survey example but after the interviews they made me realize that a survey example does not help and they believed it could be removed, so I did. I was also told that all of the information was nice, but what are they supposed to do with it all. So I included a call to action at the end that could have the person donate directly to NAMI to support mental health issues.
