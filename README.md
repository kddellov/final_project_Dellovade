# final_project_Dellovade
## Part One
### Outline
The story I will tell is justification for why all schools should implement mental health screenings to all high school aged students at the beginning of each year.
To tell the story, I will first start by showing how mental health diseases have been increasing over time and then lead that into the prevalence for high school aged students. By using the data I will show what state mental disease is in for all ages and then break it down further to the target age. Mental health diseases have an average of age of onset of about 15 years old, but average treatment doesn't begin until about 26 years of age. This is because less than 15% of high school aged kids are ever even screened. Then show the percentage of adults obtained a lifelong mental health disorder that started in high school. I will then lead my call to action to be a mental health screening that can be distributd by teachers or guidance counselors. Also, show data that pilot studies have already run to show a program like this effects on classroom behavior, class behavior and more.

### Data
Data is utilized from the National Institute for Mental Health (https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness.shtml) , and also from a study aimed at measuring the severity of mental health disorders by comparing between age groups [Linked Here](https://github.com/kddellov/final_project_Dellovade/blob/master/Project%20Data.csv). Data was also pulled from [Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services](https://github.com/kddellov/final_project_Dellovade/blob/master/Copy%20of%20NSDUHsaeExcelTab01-2016.csv). The NIMH data is very robust and can be used in various ways to show macro level trends between things such as age, race or sex. Then I will compare down to a microlevel and the prevalence of obtaining a life long mental health disorder in the target range of my story, which is high school aged kids. I intend to use the data by also adding different elements such as pre-screening and treatment percentages as well (https://www.mhanational.org/online-depression-screening-data-and-statistics-0) and (https://nces.ed.gov/blogs/nces/post/explore-data-on-mental-health-services-in-k-12-public-schools-for-mental-health-awareness-month). Then show that these disorders can turn into life long diseases that begin in high school aged students ( https://namica.org/back-to-school-guide-maintaining-mental-health/) . 

### Method and Medium
I will use ShortHand to build the visualization. All of the visualizations will be recreated in Tableau and then imported into Shorthand. Throughout the story, I will be building to the point of the importance why mental health issues need to be addressed early on in life. I can furher reinforce the amount of relationships that can be affected, and also change the course of someones life. Policy makers must be held accountable in such a big issue such as mental health disorders. So additional funding to schools should be made available. 

## Part Two
### Research Protocol
The target audience is the general public that can use this knowledge to take to their school-boards or they can support with donations to National Alliance on Mental Illness, that has classes to teach parents and teachers early warning signs of mental health disorders. I thought the best people to interview would be ones that would be affected if this became a new policy for a school. So, I interviewed my sister and two of my cousins who all have kids. Ideally, their kids would have been high school age but their ages varied with only one kid being in high school. I sent them my wireframes first, let them look and study them, and then scheduled a call to ask questions. 

My interview script was conversational and was mainly aimed at the best way to showcase the data and their ability to understand what I am showing. For each graph I wanted to know if there was anything I should remove, add, or highlight. Next, I wanted to know if they had enough supporting information to support the point I am making. I was having trouble thinking of design/color themes, so I asked about that as well.

### Changes Implemented
I was told that my theme should be different shades of green because the color for mental health awareness is green, so for all the final project it will be shades of green. All 3 of the interviewees thought I could combine some of the graphs because they were repetative, which I thought was interesting. I combined the Prevalence of Mental Disorder Age and Sex charts together. Originally the graph had age broken up into 5 different groups, but with adding more bars to the chart I had to remove 2 of the age groupings. I asked each of them again after I made the change and they believed that since my topic is worried about youth and not overall prevalence then it does not take away from the point of the graph. Someone also mentioned that I should include something subtle to be able to compare youth mental health to the average for all ages if it all possible, so I added it that to a few of the graphs. In the original story board, I included a survey example but after the interviews they made me realize that a survey example does not help and they believed it could be removed, so I did. They were all mothers and thought I should include an area that showed how mental health disorders can affect the development of their child because they think that is the fastest way to get parents to care about an issue. So I added a section with common side effects that are backed by research. I was also told that all of the information was nice, but what are they supposed to do with it all. So I included a call to action at the end that could have the person donate directly to NAMI to support mental health issues.

 ## Part Three


### Final data story

A few paragraphs that talk about the intended audience for your final data story.  Include any personas and / or other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus.  Talk about specific things you did to your final project to make it work for your audience. 

 At the very beginning of my project I thought I wanted my project to be strictly around making it mandatory for high school students to take a mental health screening at the beginning of each year. After cleaning the data and running different visualizations, my idea was not supported by the data. So, I pivoted and just brought the issues of mental health forward and framed the fix for the high spending as preventative approach aimed at high school students. So the intended audience is much more broad in the final project. The audience can be anyone wanting to learn more about mental health issues in the US and anyone researching ways to lower costs associated with mental health issues. I thought maybe make this more geared towards policy makers but I don't think there is enough data to fully support my argument from a policy presepective because it is way too high level thinking. However, this information can definitely be used for further cost and benefit analysis. 
 
A few paragraphs that summarize the work you've done so far.  Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process. (Part III)

 I unfortanutely had to do a total overhaul on my original idea because after working with the data sets I thought would be crucial, ended up being unusable. I decided to build the arugment against costs and how prevention can help lower the costs, but I still used my original idea of mental health screenings for high school students as a way to lower the overall costs and help lower the prevalence for mental health disorders in the US. 

Include a link to your updated Github repository that includes a link to your final data story (e.g. a link to your Shorthand / StoryMap or other final project).  Make sure your data story is published and publicly accessible. (Part III)

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6350819/ was used for how many students are exposed to mental health surveys in high school.
https://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/health-care/mental-health-untreated-children-research/ was the data source used to map the children per state that have a mental health disorder and also the data on how many children do not receive treatment while they have a mental health disorder.
